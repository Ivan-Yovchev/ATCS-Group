* Data-Sets:
  * Format/Preprocess the dataset, use the DataSet classes for easy batching
  * How to deal with different domains 
    * Should we treat each domain as a separate data-set?
  * Do we manually do a validation split?
    * Some data-sets are very small and making a third split can be problematic
* MAML
  * Deal with heterogenous models 
    * different number of output classes
    * should we use regression?
  * Task sampling/shuffling during training
    * Tasks have different data-sets of different sizes, how to regularize the number of epochs done per task?
    * Vary batch size?
    * Vary the K steps between tasks?
    * Sample task with or without replacement? (aka go through all tasks at each loop?)
  * Practical matters
    * How to deal with 5 and 6 in the algorithm (how many separate models do we store?)
      * consider their code as reference
    * Scale down model for local testing if cannot do a full run locally (to avoid developing on SARA)
* Multi-Task 
  * Where is the paper? How to implement the baseline?
